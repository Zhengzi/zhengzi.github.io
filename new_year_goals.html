Now a quater has passed. I am reviewing the goals set for 2017. 
<br>
It's easy to lose weight, now roughly 14kg, which is only 1kg away from the target. Therefore, instead setting a weight loss as a target,
I choose to change it to a fixed one of 75kg. Wish at the end of this year, I can keep it at 75kg, (no more, and no less than it).
I've already run a half marathon. Thus, it is not a changeling task to complete a full marathon at the end of this year.
Paper-wise, I got a journal to submit, but I am not the first author, which is ok in some senses. I plan to have two more this year, at least in submission.
For drawing, I don't have time. Put this in next year's goal.
For gf, lol, don't think it is responsible to find a gf, when I don't have much time to spend with her. 
I don't sleep well recently, but the overall is better than it last year.
Piano, difficult, only learn to play it with one hand. Try to learn one or two, which will be enough this year.
Singing, put this in next year.
Plank for 20mins, I promise this to others. Believe I can achieve this.
Go on and on, adding one thing, improve tennis skills. Play tennis more than 4 times a week, so I think I will become more professional at the end.

Ok, now let's make a new list of goals.

<ol>
  <li>Lose weight to 75kg</li>
  <li>Run a marathon</li>
  <li>Submit two papers, and one journal</li>
  <li>Girl Friend by luck, lol</li>
  <li>Play piano for two songs</li>
  <li>Plank for 20mins</li>
  <li>Play tennis more professional</li>
</ol>
