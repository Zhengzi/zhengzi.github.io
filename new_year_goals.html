  <li>Singing~~~</li>
  <li>plank for 20mins</li>
  <li>Go on and on</li>
</ol>

Now a quater has passed. I am reviewing the goals set for 2017. 
<br>
It's easy to lose weight, now roughly 14kg, which is only 1kg away from the target. Therefore, instead setting a weight loss as a target,
I choose to change it to a fixed one of 75kg. Wish at the end of this year, I can keep it at 75kg, (no more, and no less than it).
