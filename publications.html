I received my B.E. in computer science from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2015. 
I am currently pursuing doctoral degree under the supervision of Asst. Prof Liu Yang in School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, from 2015 Aug. 
My research interests include cyber security (binary level program vulnerability and patch analysis), software program analysis, and data mining (deep learning).
